== Chapter IV

After the meeting was over I returned to my father`'s house,
restored to a sense of the remaining goodness of the Lord; and that time forward,
from time to time appeared with a few words in meetings, as the Lord made way,
and gave matter, strength and utterance; but was not forward to visit any other meeting,
till I began to be a little shut up there; and then I waited on the Lord,
to know the drawings of his love to some other places,
in which I was favored through his divine goodness; and yet did not make haste,
but was kept under a slow, gentle, and gradual progress.

But now a temptation of another kind began to interrupt me; for,
having had a reputation in that country,
of an understanding at least equal to my education and years,
when my acquaintance and others heard of my appearance in a public ministry,
they expected something more from me than from some others,
of whom they had not conceived the like opinion;
and I knowing the way of Truth with me was not in the wisdom and multiplicity of words,
but in his own virtue and simplicity, and in a few sentences only, was not willing,
of myself, to yield up my own imaginary honor on that account, and be exposed as a fool,
in their way of judging.
This affected me so that I became backward to appear when such were present,
and sometimes neglected the proper times of the movings of the Lord in this calling;
by which I retarded my growth therein, and was in danger of greater loss.
But the Lord is just and merciful; and though he charged it as a failure, yet,
by degrees he helped me forward, though it was a long time before I got over it;
for it laid sometimes as a block in my way for many years after,
remaining the unmoved cause of many a heavy load; which none knew, or could ease me of,
but the Lord alone: and if he had not extended mercy I had yet been undone forever.

After this, my uneasiness in my father`'s house increasing,
I took an occasion one morning to remind him of the
change of his countenance and behavior towards me,
and of the many hints he had thought fit to give,
concerning my way of living in the world, as if I were likely to be chargeable to him,
in some other way than by the practice of the law, into which I had been initiated;
having altogether declined it, as noted before in this relation.

I told him that he could not charge me with any
act of disobedience to him from my childhood,
nor did he, or my mother, or any schoolmaster, ever correct me with the rod,
or had any cause, or with the neglect of any duty, save now, at last,
my embracing the truth of God, as my only way to salvation;
in which case he had no right to command or hinder,
but rather to consider his own ways and state,
and how far they were just and pleasing in the sight of God;
to whom I must answer for myself, where he could not for me: and then added,
that I intended to leave his house in a short time, and make him easy on that account.

This touched my dear father so near that he could not bear it, but wept abundantly;
confessing that I ever had been a dutiful child to him, and had never disobliged him,
save in that thing only; nor did he grudge anything in his power to do for me;
but as "`he had brought me up to the law he thought it
might have been a way of living in the world,
both plentiful and reputable,
but could not now see any reasonable means of a competent subsistence,
with that reputation which my circumstances required.
However, he made me this proposal, as the best he could then think of, namely:
That I should manage his estate to the best advantage I could,
and take all the incomes to myself,
save a reputable subsistence to himself and my mother-in-law, his wife.

To this I returned him my dutiful acknowledgment, but told him it was now too late.
I was fixed in another resolution, under a view of a different nature,
and could not subject myself to such a confinement, if he would, on such terms,
give me his whole estate forever: but withal assured him,
that I did not leave him under any discontent or
resentment of any behavior he had used towards me,
which he had a right to do, according to his views and meaning;
but that I had an inducement for my departure, which, probably,
he could not rightly apprehend or believe, if I should declare it;
which was no other than more perfect liberty to serve the Lord
and his people in the way of the calling of God,
which was gradually increasing at that time upon me;
and I was now grown a little stronger in the ministry,
and more experienced in the exercise of the gift of God therein.

Not long after this,
Aaron Atkinson acquainted me with his concern to visit
Friends in some south and west parts of England;
and as we had, from the time of my joining with Friends,
been very intimate and near in the Truth and love of it,
I was also willing to travel the same way; but he, being ready sooner than I could be,
went before up to London, where he stayed for me.
On the 22nd of the eleventh month 1694, I took leave of my father and his family,
and set forward for London, taking some meetings by the way,
as they happened of course to fall out; for I did not think proper to appoint any,
my thoughts of my own ministry being very low;
yet the Lord favored me with his goodness and encouraging presence,
and made way for me everywhere,
and gave me several open and comfortable times with Friends in my journey,
though altogether a stranger as to outward acquaintance with anyone;
the most satisfactory was at Leicester.
It was a hard frost, and snowed every day more or less, during most of my journey,
with a high wind for some days at first;
so that the lanes and high-ways were generally blocked up by the driven snow,
and few travelers were upon the road.
It was very bad and dangerous traveling, and I was sometimes alone riding long stages.
When I came to Leicester, having been directed to the house of honest John Brookes,
he was the first person that came to the door, and looking upon me as I sat on horseback,
gave me a kind invitation to alight; which I did,
and was received with gravity and kindness.
It was their meeting-day, the 30th of the eleventh month, in the afternoon;
and being favored with the divine presence as my only stay,
I had little to say to the family in conversation, but was much in silence;
in which I perceived I had good unity with them, for the Son of peace was there.

After some refreshment we went into the meeting-house, where the meeting was small;
and we sat in silence a considerable time before I
found my mind fully qualified to appear in public;
but being freely opened at length in the Word of Life,
the meeting was generally reached and tendered thereby to a great degree,
which was likewise renewed in prayer.
This had its right effect upon the Friends,
so that they were affectionately kind and loving after the meeting;
and most of them spent the evening with me,
and we were not strangers one to another any more, but one in the blessed Truth,
though we had never seen the faces of each other before;
and from that time forward were near in friendship, becoming outwardly acquainted also,
from that beginning, in which we had a certain evidence of the spirits of each other,
as the best and most sure foundation of a lasting and unchangeable friendship.

The next day I went forward by Northampton, Newport-Pagnell, etc.,
and on the 2nd day of the twelfth month arrived at London, where, at that time,
was a great body of good Friends, well established in the Truth, and many meetings,
and a good number of great and able ministers of the gospel among them; as William Penn,
George Whitehead, Samuel Waldenfield, William Bingley, John Vaughton, John Field,
Francis Stamper, John Bowater, James Parle, and many others of the younger sort.

Considering the many talents of the ministers, their improvement thereof, experience,
discerning, and other attainments in the Truth, in their several degrees,
their parts and qualifications as men,
as also the like qualifications of Friends there in general,
together with the politeness, knowledge and understanding of the people in that place,
I was kept very low in my mind and circumspect;
having no courage of my own to appear in public among them.
But the Lord knowing me altogether, my weakness, integrity, simplicity, and good meaning,
supported my mind under all these considerations.
Aaron Atkinson, my intended companion, having been in the city some time before,
and observing him acceptable in his ministry among them,
gave me an occasion of reasoning, that I might also, probably,
go through the meetings without offense;
which was the full amount of my expectation or desire there.
And that which added much to my encouragement was,
the fatherly care and behavior of the ministers in general,
but especially of that great minister of the gospel, and faithful servant of Christ,
William Penn; who abounded in wisdom, discretion, prudence, love,
and tenderness of affection, with all sincerity, above most in this generation;
and indeed I never knew his equal:
nor were Friends in general lacking to me in an open and tender friendship.

In this city we remained in the service of Truth and Friends,
according to our several measures and attainments;
for as Aaron had been much longer convinced of the Truth than I,
and was in the ministry some years before I yielded thereto,
he seemed by so much the better grown, stronger, experienced, and preferable.
On the 13th day of the twelfth month we had a meeting at Wandsworth;
the next day at Kingston; on the loth at Guilford; on the 16th at Alton;
on the 19th at Basingstoke; on the 20th at Whitchurch; next day at Andover;
next at Lower-Wallop, and at Salisbury on the 23rd; on the 25th at Fording-bridge;
next day at Ringwood, and on the 27th at Pool;
where we stayed till the 1st day of the first month, and then proceeded to Corse.

On the 2nd day of the first month we returned to Pool;
and from there on the 4th to Weymouth, the Lord preserving us,
and favoring us with his good presence;
and the aid of his divine grace gave us many acceptable times among his people,
and our journey and service was thereby made easy and comfortable, both to us and them.
Being thus encouraged, we proceeded further, namely: to Sherburn, Marnhill, Blandford,
Bruton, and so by Hallitro to Bristol on the 12th; and on the 13th to Bolton and Chew,
to Claverham, and so by Wrinton to Wells, from which, by Glastonbury and Street,
Grinton and Summerton; and then by Longsutton to Gregory-Stoke, Taunton, Wyvelscomb,
Collumpton, Tiverton, and Exeter; the Lord still favoring us with his goodness,
by which we were preserved and carried on in the work
and service whereunto we were called by his grace;
which was ever with us, to the sole praise of the great Giver,
who alone is worthy now and forever.

On the 1st of the second month we were at Totness, then at Plymouth, Rowle, Bodway,
Liscard, Melton, Trygongieve, Landwithen, Kellington, King`'s-bridge, Totness, Exeter,
Uffcolm, Spiceland, Collumpton, Wellington, Taunton, Michael-Creech,
and so by Grinton to Street, Glastonbury, Puddymore, and from there to Bristol.
Lodging at our ancient and honorable friend Richard Snead`'s,
one morning the canopy of the divine presence came over us in the family,
and brought us all into right silence for a time;
and then the holy spirit of prayer and supplication came upon us:
and while we were in that exercise, William Penn,
who ever loved the truth in the meanest, came into the room and joined with us;
and after him, that ancient, able, and eminent Friend and minister of the Lord Jesus,
Roger Haydock, who joined us in the same likewise; and some others following them,
all coming to see us,
were favored with the same visitation and good presence of the Lord our God,
and the enjoyment of him together in the Beloved, to our great and mutual refreshment,
edification, and consolation.

This good season being over, we had sweet and agreeable unity and conversation together;
and it proved a great strength and encouragement to my companion and me,
to be thus favored in the sight of those elders; who, by their free and fatherly,
or rather brotherly, behavior towards us then, and from that time forward,
declared a firm and settled friendship in the Truth, which never waxed old or decayed.

[.offset]
+++[+++After taking several other meetings they reached London on the 8th of third month.]

In this journey, though we were not without temptations and exercises of various kinds,
yet the Lord was near to preserve us; and through his divine grace, gave us many open,
comfortable and edifying times in the assemblies of his people, and in families,
as also in conversation; for the fear of the Lord was over us,
and we did not delight in vain and unprofitable talk, but were kept solid;
but not cast down, or unconversable.

At London we parted; Aaron went back into Cumberland, and I remained in the city,
and entered into business there for my necessary subsistence:
for my father had not bestowed anything upon me at parting.

The first thing I did was to sell my horse, which I rode in my late journey,
for which I got about seven pounds, and with it I put myself into some better clothing;
for what I had was much worn out with riding.
Friends in London knowing my intention of settling there, at least for some time,
and that I desired to be employed in conveyancing, drawing of settlements,
and other public writings of all sorts; which was a business I was acquainted with,
and also the least confining of any I could think of, and was fitted for;
several of them were so kind as to give notice
of it in some monthly meetings in the city,
and on other occasions;
and recommended me to such Friends as might have anything to be done in that way.
William Penn, in a particular manner, was liberal in his recommendations,
and showed himself a warm friend in promoting my interest.

This succeeded so well, by the blessing of God,
that in a short time I had more business than I could do by myself,
so that I often employed assistants.
As I was rather under than over in my demands for what business I did,
so my pay was good and sure,
and I soon came into a reputable and plentiful way of living;
for which I was truly thankful to the Lord,
who thus provided for me in a way I had not foreseen; but had fully trusted in the Lord,
that I should not lack,
though without any particular prospect how I should be
supplied when I left my father`'s house to follow the Lord,
and enjoy his divine peace more fully than I found I could do there.

Remaining some time in the city,
Friends employed me to record the foreign sufferings sent, from all parts,
to the chamber there; for which they allowed me a gratuity; and after that,
put all the deeds and writings belonging to the
quarterly meeting of London into my hands,
to peruse and consider; and in several of them I found mistakes, which were rectified.
I made a general index and abstract of them, whereby the purport of any deed,
and what set of trustees the title of any meeting-house or burying-ground was in,
at any time, might be found in a quarter of an hour;
for which also I had a consideration.

I kept close to meetings and to business, in their proper places;
the countenance of the Lord was with me,
and my business increased daily to my satisfaction,
so that I had several offers of clerks, with competent sums of money,
both from the north, and in London.
But considering that as tending to too deep an engagement in the affairs of life,
and a confinement not consisting with the liberty requisite in the ministry,
or with my views that way, I declined,
and did my business with the help of such writing
clerks as I could employ on any emergency,
without further engagement.

About this time George Keith,
that contentious apostate from the truth of God once made known to him,
made great disturbances in and about London,
as he had done before in various parts of America;
endeavoring to impose some unprofitable, hurtful,
and false notions of his own and others upon Friends, contending fiercely about them;
and had also obtained some regard from envious and
prejudiced persons of various sects and societies.

In this same year, +++[+++1696]
I was concerned, in the love of Truth, to visit the meetings in a general way,
in the north of England, and likewise in Scotland; and in discharge of that duty,
set forward from London on the 6th or 7th of the fifth month,
accompanied by Henry Atkinson; who was at that time, a very tender and hopeful young man,
but had not appeared in a public ministry, though truth was working in him towards it.

We went by Waterford, where I made a visit to the countess of Carlisle,
intending to have seen the earl, but he was gone to London,
and she received me in her closet with respect, none being present but Helen Fairley,
who had been her gentlewoman; but having been lately convinced,
another was then in her place.
The countess asked me several questions concerning the way of truth as professed by us;
of the sacraments, commonly so called, of women`'s preaching, of our marriages,
and of the grace of God, etc.
To all which I answered in much plainness, and I believe, to her satisfaction,
as follows:

"`As to the two sacraments,
the national church owns that a sacrament is an outward
and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace;
and if it is a sign, it cannot be the thing signified.
That grace, of which those symbols are called signs, has appeared, and does appear,
unto all men; as well where those signs are used,
as where they are not used or heard of So that there
can be no advantage in the use of such signs,
but in that grace which, through Christ, is given of the Father unto all men,
being a divine active principle and power, illuminating,
instructing and guiding the minds of all that believe therein,
into all truth necessary for the salvation of the soul.
The great God, Creator of heaven and earth.
King of kings, and Lord of lords,
is no respecter of persons in his dispensation of grace to the children of men;
but gives more or less as it pleases him, but to every one that which is sufficient;
and has no regard therein to those distinctions, formed and imposed by mortals,
one upon another, in this world: so that high and low, rich and poor, noble and ignoble,
have all grace sufficient for their salvation, if they believe therein and obey it;
as it is written, '`By grace are you saved, through faith, and that not of yourselves,
it is the gilt of God.`'
Yet you who are great in this world are in most danger, because of the cares, riches,
pleasures, honors, and glory of it; for as the Most High regards none of these things,
but considers you only as others of mankind,
these high stations and circumstances delude your hearts by their glittering delights,
and betray you into a forgetfulness of God your Creator,
and a neglect of the gift of his grace which is in you,
though the Lord is not lacking to you in his kind and
merciful admonitions and reproofs in your own minds.

"`And though you are sometimes brought thereby
into inward and deep considerations of your ways,
your latter end, and a future state, as others are;
yet you are under greater disadvantages through the eminence
of your stations and circumstances in the world,
being thereby placed out of the reach of the conversation and
information of the true and sincere ministers of the Lord Jesus;
who, as they love you truly, through his grace, would deal plainly,
yet discreetly and respectfully with you,
for the sake and redemption of your precious souls, without any flattery,
or mean mercenary end, or other earthly view.

"`But it is lamentable to consider, that when the grace of God,
as it is the divine light of his presence through the Lord Jesus Christ,
lets you see yourselves, and the errors of your ways; and brings remorse over you,
and a secret humiliation and sadness into your minds,
appearing sometimes in your aspect and behavior; when none of your pastimes, enjoyments,
or diversions have any relish, or afford any satisfaction at all; then,
instead of the counsel and help of such as have known this word of reproof,
and walked in the path of life eternal,
to direct you in the way which leads to the kingdom of God,
and to that unspeakable glory, the beatific vision of his countenance, which never ends,
as all this world, and the glory and pleasures of it do, even in a moment,
and are known no more; you have two sorts of men in particular near you,
by whose ignorance, self-views and flattery,
you are in more danger of everlasting ruin than those in lower stations.
For, in the times of humiliation, when you are fittest for the teachings of God,
as it is written, '`The humble he will teach,
and the meek he will guide in judgment,`' then your priests say you are melancholy;
a ball, or other unchristian-like diversion must be promoted,
and your physicians must give physic to your bodies; then,
alas! the sickness is in the soul, and they know it not,
and can never be cured but by the Physician of value,
the High Priest of God and Savior of the soul;
who first slays in it the vain and sinful life of the world,
in which all the evils thereof dwell, and then breathes into it life eternal,
the life of Jesus the Son of God, who never fell.

"`As to women`'s preaching, it ought to be impartially observed,
that the difference of sexes consists not in any
diversity of faculties in the human soul;
the intellectual powers being alike common to male and female,
and the nature of the mind the same in both,
and consequently susceptible of the like and same impressions and impulses.
And accordingly the Almighty,
pointing at the dispensation of the gospel by Joel the prophet, says,
'`I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh;
and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy.`'
Again, '`Upon the servants and upon the handmaids, in those days,
will I pour out my Spirit.`'
By the word prophesy is understood, by all interpreters, preaching the gospel;
and this prophesy took place in the church of Christ at the coming of the Holy Ghost,
or Christ in spirit, at Jerusalem, at the time of Pentecost; where, if no woman spoke,
though we have no express account that any did,
the apostle Peter did not apply that text properly and without exception;
which we are not to suppose.

"`Though the apostle Paul takes some exceptions, and that with sharpness,
against some women as to that exercise in the church, yet not against all;
for himself declares how women, using that exercise, ought to be circumstanced,
and recommends Phebe as a minister of the church which was at Cenchrea;
and Philip had four daughters, all preachers; and Priscilla,
as well as Aquilla her husband, was a preacher in the days of the apostles; and she,
as well as he, instructed Apollos further in the way of Christ,
though he had been a preacher before.
I conclude therefore, with truth, that women both may and ought to preach,
under the gospel dispensation, when the Spirit of the Lord is upon them,
and they thereunto called, and qualified thereby; and many such we have now among us,
very acceptable in their ministry.
So that we know by experience, that they are sent of God,
according to the various degrees of their gifts, as well as men,
and receive them accordingly in the Lord.`"

She heard what I said with candor and patience,
and I took leave of her with great satisfaction in my mind.
And this visit being over, I returned to the house of our friend Alice Hayes;
where I related the passage, with other circumstances here omitted,
to several Friends there at that time, which well affected them;
and we were all favored with the divine presence on the occasion,
and had a very comfortable time together in prayer;
after which we departed towards Albans, where we had appointed a meeting that afternoon,
and then went to Hartford.

The next day, being the 9th of the month, we had a meeting there;
which at first was very hard and shut up, but ended well,
in a weighty sense of the divine presence.

That evening we went to John Etteridge`'s, at Hare-Street,
and next day had a meeting near that place; which at first was drowsy, hard and dry,
but after a while, became as a little river overflowing its banks,
to the comfort and refreshment of the Friends and us,
and to the honor of the name of the Lord; of whom alone is the power,
which he dispenses when and where he pleases.
That evening we returned to the same lodging,
and the next morning a concern came upon our minds,
and John Etteridge being much spent in a consumption,
uttered a few sentences concerning a day coming on apace,
wherein the Lord would gather many, as from the four winds, to sit down with Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of God, in divine rest and peace;
and after prayer we departed, greatly comforted, as also were the Friends in the family.

That day we had a meeting at Baldook; which, for a while, was poor and dry,
but in the end a little better.

The 12th, being the first-day of the week, we were at Cambridge; where came two priests,
several young collegians, and some other people; they were sober,
and the meeting was peaceable.
From there we went by Huntington to Stilton, Wentsford, and so on to Nottingham,
and on the 15th fell in with the meeting at Mansfield, which was small and poor;
and that evening went to Balbur-Hall, and lodged with sir John Rhodes, baronet; who,
being convinced of the Truth very young, embraced the same under the cross,
forsaking all the honor of this world, and the friendship of it,
for that honor which is of God only,
and the friendship and fellowship of the faithful and sanctified in Christ,
of whom he is beloved and honored in the truth as worthy.

From there we went to Sheffield, and so to Burton, to Francis Harrison`'s,
where we lodged; from there through Leeds, and by several stages into Cumberland,
and on the 5th of the sixth month, being the fourth of the week,
we were at the Border meeting.

On the 7th of the sixth month we began our journey into Scotland,
and next day arrived at Kelso, where, on the first of the week,
we were at a meeting in the forenoon, and another in the afternoon, to our satisfaction;
on the 11th we were at the meeting at Edinburgh, and next day crossed the Firth,
in order for the north, and that night lodged at Coupar, in Fifeshire;
where we could get neither grass, hay, nor straw for our horses, but only thistles.

On the 13th we lodged at our friend William Napier`'s of Tacks, near Montrose,
and being willing to hasten to the farthest part
of our journey before the winter came on,
went to the widow Barclay`'s, at Urie, and were at a seventh-day`'s meeting at Aberdeen,
which went from family to family by turns.

The day following, being the first of the week,
we went to a six-weeks meeting at Woodland, about nine miles, which was large,
but not very comfortable; but having another meeting that afternoon at John Forbes`',
we were favored of the Lord with some more divine refreshment in his presence;
and there we remained that night and the next day.

The day following we had a pretty comfortable meeting with a few Friends at Inverary;
in the evening we went to Kilmuck, and next day had a small meeting there;
after which I was very well and easy, and that evening went to Aberdeen,
where we had a meeting next day to satisfaction; and another in the evening.

The next day we had an evening meeting in the said town,
at the house of our ancient and eminent friend Andrew Jaffray,
where the Lord favored us with his life-giving presence to a good degree,
several persons of note in the world being there.
They behaved very solidly, and I had an open time among them, through the grace of God,
especially in prayer, to the praise of the great Giver of every good and perfect gift,
who is worthy now and forever.

On the 22nd of the sixth month we had another meeting there,
which was very open and tender; after it was over,
we visited Friends in their families in a general way,
and the next day being the first of the week,
we had two more good and open meetings in the fore and afternoon;
and there I took public leave of Friends in those parts:
but next morning before we departed,
the generality of the ancient Friends came to see us,
and being together in John Hall`'s house, where we lodged,
the power of the Lord came upon us, and we were greatly comforted together therein.
At that time my companion spoke a few words seasoned with grace, to general satisfaction;
and then I had also a few sentences, concerning the bond of our unity and communion,
which is the spirit and love of Christ, and then had a tender season in prayer;
after which Andrew Jaffray likewise prayed,
and so the meeting concluded to our mutual consolation:
and in the remaining sense of the love of our heavenly Father we parted,
and that afternoon went to Urie.

Here we stayed till the 26th, and then had a meeting, which was heavy for some time,
but ended in a more lively state; for which we were thankful.
Next morning we had a meeting in the family of the widow of Robert Barclay,
where we were much comforted together,
in the springings of the love of our heavenly Father;
and greatly were we satisfied to find his divine presence so near them, not only then,
but also on the sixth and seventh days following;
for they have a meeting every morning among themselves.

On the 29th we went back to William Napier`'s, and next day, being the first of the week,
we were at the meeting at Montrose, fore and afternoon:
in the latter several people came in,
and I said many things to them appertaining to salvation,
but they did not seem to be weary or heavy laden, or fit for the cross of Christ,
nor sensible of any need.
The next morning we went from Tayck, where we had lodged,
and William Napier conducted us several miles, and was very kind,
and that night we lodged at Kennoway.

The 1st day of the seventh month we went to Kinghorn, in order to pass over to Leith;
where we found a ferry boat ready to put off from the shore,
in which were several passengers, and among the rest an Episcopal priest.
As soon as he perceived what we were, he fell into a rage,
and endeavored to keep us out of the vessel, and disappoint us of our passage;
which he seemed more bold in, under the countenance of a young gentleman in the boat,
who, by his appearance, seemed to be the priest`'s patron or benefactor.
But I soon gave him to understand we were not to be imposed upon in that point;
and insisting on our passage, required the boatman to take in our horses,
and we stepped in after them;
and then his spirit fell when he saw our resolution and management,
and that the gentleman did not oppose us.
The priest becoming more calm, so did the wind, which had retarded our passage.

After a while, perceiving the spirit of the man to be overcome and quieted,
I spoke to him concerning his passion and enmity against us without any cause;
putting him in mind how inconsistent such behavior is with Christianity,
of which I supposed him to be a professor, if not a professed teacher;
and that religion requires all the professors of it to be kind to strangers;
and that though he was equally a stranger to us, as we to him,
yet since we were strangers in his native country,
that character belonged more properly to us.

This calm reasoning with him, in the grace of God, had so good an effect,
that he confessed his fault, and desired it might be passed by; which was freely granted.
Then, as we stood together by the side of the vessel, he became very kind and familiar,
and told me he was, by profession, an Episcopal minister, but displaced,
and deprived of his living by the Presbyterians at the revolution.
I informed him that I had been of the same profession of religion;
that my nearest relations were so still,
and my elder brother a dean of the Episcopal church; +++[+++relating also]
the manner of my education, my leaving the profession of the law,
as not consisting with the calling of God in the concern I was then about; and yet,
casting myself on his Providence, I lacked nothing.

I advised him, that since, in the course of Providence,
he was divested of his bread in the way he had chosen for himself,
he had best now lean upon the arm of the Lord for his subsistence,
in a way which might be shown him, in some honest employment,
in case he should look no more back to his former dependence:
all I said he heard with temper, and said he believed I wished him well therein.

The young gentleman said a little pleasantly,
"`he himself had a mind to dispute with me on the subject of baptism.`"
"`Then,`" said I, "`before we begin the dispute, answer me one question;
how many baptisms are there in use in the Christian religion?`"
He answered, "`There are three.`"
Then I told him he would make but a poor hand in dispute,
who had missed it so far in the entrance.
"`For whereas the apostle Paul says, '`There is one Lord, one faith,
and one baptism,`' you say there are three baptisms; and since you oppose the apostle,
you are not fit to be disputed with about religion.`"
And not being in earnest in what he had proposed, he only smiled,
and dropped his pretension.

Then he addressed himself to the passengers, and said, concerning Friends,
"`They are a people who give no honor to any, nor seek any, and yet are honored of all;
being admitted into the company and friendship of men
of all stations and degrees without offense,
because they make their plain behavior an incident of their religion,
and badge of their profession.
And their principles leading them to peace with all sorts, and against wars and fighting,
while other professors destroy one another, and thereby lessen their numbers,
this people are still increasing.`"
This he spoke pleasantly, and not seeing need to reply, or make any observation upon it,
I let it pass; and so all that looked like contest ceased,
and they continued very sociable till we went on shore, and when we were landed,
they invited us to drink a glass of wine with them, but that we excused,
and parting with them in friendship, went forward to Edinburgh.

We rested at Edinburgh the remaining part of that day,
and on the next we had a peaceable, tender, and comfortable meeting with Friends;
on the sixth and seventh of the week we visited Friends at their houses;
and on the first-day following, were at their fore and afternoon meetings;
and though some rudeness appeared in a few of the baser sort of the people,
yet the Lord`'s power was over all in us,
and many of the better sort were very sober and attentive.
We met with no rudeness in the streets, save from one man, who,
falling in with me and my companion, looked furiously on us as we passed by,
having a great broad-sword with a basket hilt, and said,
"`The Quakers should all be shot!`"
Upon which I turned quickly upon him, and looking him steadily in the face, asked him,
"`Why so?
What hurt have the Quakers done to deserve destruction?`"
To which he made no reply, but sheered off as one condemned in his own conscience.

On the 7th we went to Linlithgow,
and next morning the Lord favored us with his heart-tendering presence,
with a few of his gathered people there.

On the 10th day of the seventh month we had a meeting at Garthshore;
where the power of darkness was very strong, through one Andrew Gray,
who had been wise and great in his own conceit; and like Diotrephes,
had ruled by his own authority, which he had assumed over the sincere and honest minded;
and though he was become an apostate from the life of truth, yet came to meetings,
where he ever brought a cloud with him; for his dark spirit was that cloud,
and Friends could have no unity with him: yet the truth was over all,
and as he could do us no hurt, the meeting concluded well.

The next day we had a meeting at Glasgow; where came a great many collegians,
with a mob of other people.
They were very rude, both in words and actions, as generally that sort everywhere are.
It is a lamentable thing to consider, that people of the age of discretion,
and professing the name of the true God, and of Jesus Christ the Son of God,
the Messiah and Savior of the world, should be so blind concerning that religion,
as to think, if they think about it at all,
that such brutish creatures as those collegians are,
can be ministers of Christ in that condition;
being commonly promoted out of that mint wherein they are coined,
not in the image of God, but of the adversary;
from wallowing in all manner of vice and immorality,
to pretend to teach those who have far more understanding in religion than themselves.
Nevertheless so it is.
Being reproved at that time in the Word of Life,
they were a little more sober for a while; but growing rude again,
a soldier who had been in the meeting most of the time, reprehended them sharply, saying,
that if anything was said they did not like, they might let it alone;
but if it was right why did they not receive it.
And so stupid were they that they had nothing to say in answer to the soldier;
neither to us did they make any objection.
Towards the conclusion of the meeting, my companion expressed some edifying matter,
in great humility and tenderness, that was acceptable to the sensible part,
which was the second time he had appeared that way.
After all the rude endeavors to disturb us, the meeting ended in divine peace,
and in a sense of the love and goodness of the Lord; which is a present,
as well as future reward,
far exceeding all that can be suffered for it in this short life and momentary world.

On the 12th, being the sixth of the week, we went to Askeen,
to our friend William Simson`'s, where we had a very hard meeting,
and the next morning back to Glasgow, where we stayed till the first-day,
and then had two very hard and dry meetings.
Those who came to the meetings were outwardly civil,
yet so strong was the power of darkness,
and so great the enmity against the life of truth,
and so little the faith in that Presbyterian people,
that we were that night greatly laden in our spirits, and rested but little.

Next morning we went to Hamilton, and in the evening had a meeting there,
which was very poor and low, for things were then in a declining condition at that place;
from which we set forward on the 16th, for Cumberland,
where we arrived on the 15th following,
in good health through the mercy and goodness of the Lord.

In this journey through Scotland we were presented, in several places,
with further instances of the irreligion and cruelty of the Presbyterians of that nation,
which demonstrated them to be of the same persecuting
spirit of their brethren in New England;^
footnote:[Between the years of 1656 and 1661,
a violent and merciless persecution was exercised by
the Presbyterian government in New England;
several laws and declarations being published, with severe penalties annexed,
against any Quakers being allowed to land or live within that Colony.
In consequence of which,
the rage of blind zeal and furious bigotry rose
as high as in the worst and darkest times;
so that a great number of innocent and peaceful persons were cruelly imprisoned,
and barbarously used, without any regard either to sex or age.
Many were starved in jails,
and inhumanly beaten and whipped with knotted cords and pitched ropes;
others suffered by grievous fines, confiscations, and loss of ears; and three persons,
namely: William Robinson, Marmaduke Stevenson, and Mary Dyer,
were executed on the gallows in 1659, and William Leddra in 1660:
none of whom appeared guilty of any fault, but the exercise of their religious duties.
Where this hot persecution would have ended is unknown,
had not King Charles II interposed his royal authority,
and put an end to it by his letter, dated at Whitehall, the 9th of September, 1661.]
and that they only lacked power to practice the like,
or greater destruction on Friends and others,
differing from their imaginations in matters of religion.
A few of which being inserted here, may confirm this observation, and are as follow:

[.numbered]
1+++.+++ The General Assembly of the Kirk of Scotland, published the following act:
"`Edinburgh, December 24th, Post Meridian.
The General Assembly of this national church,
for the preventing of the growth of those abominable heresies of the Quakers,
do recommend to all provincial synods, Presbyteries, ministers, and kirk-sessions,
to use all proper means for reclaiming them; and in case of their obstinacy,
to proceed against them with the censures of the church;
and especially against the ringleaders,
that are traffickers for the seducing of others.`"

[.numbered]
2+++.+++ John Gillespie, one of the elders of the Presbyterian church at Glasgow,
going to the house of George Swan, a Friend, who was an innkeeper in that city,
exhorted and commanded his wife, she being a Presbyterian,
that if any of the Quakers should come to their house, she should beat them,
and her husband too, if he should encourage them.
And in this she proved obedient; for, in my presence, she dragged a Friend of the town,
who came to see us, off his seat by the hair of his head upon the floor,
and trampled him under her feet,
though he had given her no other provocation than by coming into the room where we were,
to see us, being strangers among them.

[.numbered]
3+++.+++ The same woman having asked John Pickiethlie, another of their elders,
whether she might go to the burial of a child of one of our friends;
or if it was lawful for her so to do?
He replied, "`They ought not to be buried, but burnt in the place where they die.`"

[.numbered]
4+++.+++ The said George Swan, debating some principles of Friends with John Hay,
another of the elders of the kirk, who inveighed vehemently against Friends,
as if holding damnable erroneous doctrines;
and having one of Robert Barclay`'s catechisms, requested the said John Hay to read it,
where he might find the principles of Friends illustrated with proofs from Scripture:
whereupon the said John Hay answered, "`I had rather look the devil in the face,
than look upon your books.`"

[.numbered]
5+++.+++ In further pursuance of the aforesaid Act of Assembly,
some of the said ministers of Glasgow, in their pulpits, called us heretics, blasphemers,
deluders, possessed with the devil, etc.,
saying we ought not to be admitted to live among the inhabitants there;
charging them not to converse, nor have any dealings, with us; telling them,
that we were as dangerous to come near as those who have the plague.
And one of them declared in his sermon to the people,
that he had rather converse with the devil than with the Quakers.

[.numbered]
6+++.+++ They have read several papers in the places of their worship,
charging the people not to converse with the Quakers, nor let them any houses,
nor have any dealings with them; and not to come near their meetings,
so as to join in anything with them,
upon pain of excommunication from their communion-table.

[.numbered]
7+++.+++ Many, both of the magistrates and commonalty,
pursuant to those instructions and directions of their teachers,
were in a rage whenever they saw Friends;
and the people often threw dirt and stones at them in the streets; frequently crying out,
"`Stone those Quakers to death, for the ministers have excommunicated them:`" and this,
sometimes in the sight of the magistrates, without any reproof from them;
whereby those cruelties were encouraged and established.

[.numbered]
8+++.+++ Some Friends having had occasion to rent houses or rooms in the city or suburbs,
the same were violently, taken from them by the magistrates, saying,
"`There shall no Quakers be here;`" threatening also to turn such of them out of
their houses as had been inhabitants there before this persecution began.

[.numbered]
9+++.+++ And generally, when any Friends from other parts visited those in Scotland,
the people were extremely rude and turbulent,
abusing them as they lately did two from England, by casting stones and dirt upon them;
as likewise, since that, three more from the same nation,
who were going with some Friends to their meeting at Glasgow,
whom a great company of insolent Presbyterian people followed,
casting stones and dirt at them all the way;
and afterwards broke the windows of the meeting-house,
throwing great stones in much fury, as if they would have beat it down.

[.numbered]
10+++.+++ Sometimes they have stoned and be-dirted our friends in
the very time of their prayers to Almighty God;
and women have been violently thrown down stone stairs, with their heads foremost.

[.numbered]
11+++.+++ At other times Friends have been dragged down stairs out of their meetings,
and their blood shed by the rabble; and often they have been thrown down in the streets,
and their mouths filled with dirt: and when they went into houses for shelter,
the houses were beset and in danger till they were turned out,
and then they were sorely beaten, and otherwise affronted,
scoffed and abused by the insolent rabble.

[.numbered]
12+++.+++ At other times, when our friends have been in their own houses,
they have thrown stones in at their windows, to the hazard of their limbs, eyes,
and lives: and their elders have gone about among the victuallers and ale-houses,
forbidding them to sell the Quakers either food or drink; intending,
as far as in them lay, to starve Friends to death.

Many of these cruel and unreasonable practices being
committed by the people in the view of the magistrates,
they did not suppress, but encouraged such doings, by smiling upon the actors.
So that Friends could look upon the rabble in no other
light than as the hands of those magistrates,
whereby they persecuted them, and as far as they were permitted,
accomplished their own depraved and cruel wills upon them and their poor children,
contrary to the true and good end of the institution of magistracy,
as a terror to evil-doers, and not to abuse, but protect the innocent.

The conduct of such magistrates was, both in what they acted and were passive,
contrary to the commands of God, and to the injunctions and doctrine of the Lord Jesus,
and the morality of his gospel;
which teaches us to do unto all men as we would have them do unto us.

It was also contrary to the king`'s mind and edicts,
and destructive of the just liberty of his subjects; so that both priests, magistrates,
and people, exalted themselves in the destroying power of antichrist;
holding up his kingdom and laws above the laws of God and the king,
and of civil society and a Christian life.

All which doings and omissions gave Friends cause to believe and fear,
that what they were informed of by some among them more humane and Christian than these,
was true, that there was a combination of the priests and magistrates in Glasgow,
totally to extirpate our friends out of the city.

A collection of the said contrivances and practices being made,
with intent to lay it before the king, the following address was subjoined:
"`All which we humbly offer to the consideration of the king,
and entreat such speedy redress therein, as the Lord,
by his peaceable wisdom may open in your mind: and that the God of peace,
the Lord and giver of life, may direct you to that course,
which may be most to his honor, conducive to your own everlasting peace,
the present and future help and safety of a few of the oppressed people of God,
loyal and dutiful subjects of the king, and the most honorable to those our persecutors;
who thus dishonor the Almighty, the king, magistracy, and themselves,
by their unchristian doings.`"
But though the said address was drawn up and designed for the king`'s view,
I do not remember that it was delivered to him; but rather think it was postponed,
in hopes that the Lord, in his mercy and time, might convince them of their errors,
and reform them; which was all our friends desired, not revenge.

Having finished what relates to this journey in Scotland, I return to Cumberland; where,
having visited most of the meetings in the space of about two months,
we set forward from there on the 7th of the tenth month;
and that evening went to Jacob Moor`'s, at Welgill, in Alston-Moor; a wild,
mountainous country, and in a time of hard frost and deep snow.

On the 8th we were favored of the Lord with a very open and comfortable meeting,
the Lord`'s tendering presence being with us;
and after the meeting we went about three miles further, to West-Allandale; where,
in the evening, came to us several Friends, and among others,
our ancient and honorable friend Cuthbert Featherstone.
As we were conversing together in that friendship which
the Lord begets in those who are his,
he drew our minds under the canopy of divine silence; in which, remaining for a time,
we had a heavenly visitation of his soul-melting goodness together.
Observing the tears to trickle down from the eyes of our ancient Friend,
through his long white beard upon his clothes,
I was greatly affected with love towards him from the same cause;
and had this hope and confidence upon that occasion,
that as I then observed the Lord was as near his children in old age,
who had served him faithfully from the time of their visitation,
as when he first revealed himself, through his Son the Lord Jesus, in their hearts,
so he would be with me also in advanced years, if I proved faithful and true to the Lord,
and attained that degree.

This encouragement, in the beginning of our journey,
by that tender season in the presence of the Lord, is not to be forgotten,
but had in lasting remembrance, to the praise of the Lord our God,
the giver of every good and perfect gift,
and the life and length of the days of his redeemed and saved people.

On the 9th we went to East-Allandale; where we had a threshing meeting,
and got some corn, which made amends for our hard labor.
Next day we went to Steele, where we met with our friend Archibald Gillespie,
who had been my school-fellow when we were boys,
and had embraced the Presbyterian notions in the time of his youth;
but being visited of the Lord, had obeyed from the heart,
and become a sincere and valuable Friend,
adorning his profession by an innocent and upright life and conduct.
He went with us about thirteen miles, to Benfieldside,
where we lodged at Thomas Hunter`'s; and the next evening we had a meeting at Iviston,
which was but dull and cloudy: but we had learned, in some measure, not only to abound,
but also how to be content and subject under a lesser degree;
and to do the harder as well as the more easy part of the service of the Lord,
our good and righteous Master.

On the 12th we went to Newcastle upon Tyne, and being the seventh-day of the week,
we were at the meeting there the next day, and the Lord was with us;
and also on the second-day, at their monthly meeting.

Sir Thomas Liddel of Ravensworth-castle, baronet, having taken notice of me,
on some account, at his house before I frequented the meetings of Friends,
and hearing of my present profession, and being a person of great civility and candor,
he had desired a Friend of Newcastle to invite me to Ravensworth to dine with him,
when at any time I might happen to come that way.
The Friend informing me of this, I went accordingly, accompanied by him and another;
and we were kindly and respectfully received and entertained by sir Thomas and his son,
with whom we had much conversation, in a very friendly manner, till near night;
and among other things, he told us, he had a great respect for us as a people,
and liked our way,
being sensible of that principle of divine light and truth we professed;
but he commonly went to the Presbyterian meeting.
And then he asked me whether a man might not serve and
worship God in his mind among any sort of people,
though he might differ from them in his sentiments in some points,
and in his secret judgment, like the way of some other people better?

Thus, perceiving he was convinced of the way of truth in his understanding,
and that he stumbled at the cross, and the meanness of the appearance of Friends,
I answered, that the Lord Jesus Christ said, "`Whosoever shall deny me before men,
him also will I deny before my Father and the holy angels.`"
And the apostle also says, "`With the heart man believes unto righteousness,
and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.`"
And again, time was when the people and elect of God were intermixed,
in outward situation, with the inhabitants of Mystery Babylon, the anti-christian church,
throughout the world, professing the name of the true God, and Jesus Christ,
the Son of God and Savior of the world.
But at length the voice of the angel of God was heard, saying, "`Come out of her,
my people, that you be not partakers of her sins,
and that you receive not of her plagues.`"

Upon the pouring out of the vial by the seventh angel,
"`the great city was divided into three parts,
and the cities of three nations fell,`" etc.
To which the beginning of the reformation, commonly so called, by Martin Luther,
John Calvin, and others their contemporaries, may be reasonably compared;
since the supposed Christian world was thereupon, and soon after,
divided in three general parts or heads, namely: Popery, Prelacy, and Presbytery;
differing in their several notions and communions each from the other,
but all of one persecuting spirit, not only hating and destroying one another,
being out of the peaceable Spirit of Christ,
but also persecuting all besides who dissent from them, wherever they have had power;
and their respective successors, in the same spirit and notions,
continue to do the same things,
contrary both to the nature and end of the Christian faith and religion,
which proclaims peace on earth, and good-will towards all men.

But now, in these latter days,
the voice of the angel of the right hand of the Majesty on High is uttered,
and going over the nations louder and louder; and the elect of God have heard,
and do hear it, and many are gathered,
and more are gathering into one body and one spirit.
And it is not lawful for them to stay any longer where they have been,
but to desert Babylon, the false church thus divided in itself, which cannot stand,
but must shortly fall, through the mighty Word of God; and antichrist, who rules therein,
shall be destroyed by the brightness of the coming and glory of the Son of God.

As for us, who are at this day scornfully nick-named Quakers by the children of Babel,
it is remarkable that we became a people by the gathering arm of the Lord,
by the convictions of his holy Spirit,
and the assent of the understanding to the testimony and baptism of one Spirit,
the Spirit of truth and of Christ, which leads into all truth; and not by any notions,
or faiths, or creeds, or articles contrived by the art and will of man,
or by any subscriptions, oaths, or agreements thereunto; and yet settled, as it were,
at once, in one uniformity of doctrine, principle, practice, and discipline,
which no other people ever did so fully, since the days of the apostles of Christ.

They heard me with patience;
but what I said gave no countenance to the way in which this great and rich
man had chosen to conceal himself and his real sentiments from the world.
I found it to be my place and duty to be plain with him,
according to all that was presented in my mind on that occasion,
that I might keep my own peace, which remained in me.
He told me he had read some of William Penn`'s works,
and would willingly ride a hundred miles to see him.
He had likewise read some of George Keith`'s books, and said the former wrote in a free,
open, natural, and flowing style, and gave him great satisfaction;
but the books of the latter were more labored and artificial,
and never afforded him any relish of sweetness, though the matter was, in itself, true,
and his reasoning often strong; but as he was fallen away from his principles,
he was not to be regarded;
though the truths he had written would remain in their own weight,
whatever became of the author.

In the evening, when we inclined to return to Newcastle, he took his horse,
and accompanied us till we came near the town, and we parted in free and open friendship.

The same evening I visited Dr. Richard Gilpin, formerly mentioned,
having still a great respect for him and all his family.
He was an eminent physician, and preacher among the Presbyterians at Newcastle;
to which place he had removed from Cumberland after the revolution.
With him also I had some discourse about matters of religion;
in which he discovered more passion and prejudice than
became his high profession or years,
and could not bear any contradiction; but I advised him to beware of that spirit,
for it lacked mortification: and this I did in a calm and respectful mind,
which reached the better part in him, and brought it over the evil,
and then I left him in a loving temper.

For though he was naturally high,
and the most eminent and celebrated preacher of that profession in the north,
and from his very early days, deeply prejudiced, and almost envious against Friends;
yet he heard me with more patience, though that was little, than he ever did any other.

On the 16th day of the tenth month we went to Shields, and had a meeting,
where the Lord mercifully favored us with a glorious tender
season of the sweet heavenly virtue from his presence;
to whom be renown forever.
Next day we had an evening meeting at Sunderland, which was pretty comfortable;
and from there we went by Shotton, to Stockton,
and on the 22nd had an evening meeting at Yarm; and from there proceeded by Stoxley,
Broughton, Gisborough, and Waterfall, having meetings in various places,
and so on by Rousby and Hinderwell, to Whilby, taking meetings along as we went.
From there we passed forward to Staintondale, and to Scarborough, Burlington, Hastrip,
Langtuft and Malton; from which we went to York, where, on a first-day,
we had two meetings, and then went on to Shipwith, Selby, Rowcliff, Thorn, and Lincoln;
and on the 13th day of the eleventh month, were at a burial at Waddington,
where the Lord was pleased to favor us with his good presence, as at many other times,
to our great refreshment and addition of strength.

On the 14th we went to Blocksholm, to William Thornton`'s; he was not a Friend,
but received us with respect, and after dinner we went to Sleaford,
and then by Spalding to Lynn, where we were favored with a comfortable meeting;
and from there to Stoke, Bland, and Edmondsbury, and on the 22nd were at Colchester,
where we had several good meetings, through the favor of the Lord,
who never fails to comfort and support those who love, fear, and faithfully serve him,
his children and people, according to his high and holy calling in Christ.
On the 26th we had a meeting at Boxtead, and returned that evening to Colchester,
and the next day were at a meeting at Kelden; from which, on the 28th,
we returned to London, with thankful hearts and acknowledgments to the Lord our God, who,
by the hand of his good providence, preserved us in this journey,
through many exercises and dangers both of body and mind, to his own high praise;
to whom be dominion, glory and thanks, now and forever.

[.offset]
Soon after we arrived at London, I received a letter from an unknown hand,
upon subjects of great importance; my answer to which,
including the material part of the said letter, was as follows:

[.embedded-content-document.letter]
--

[.salutation]
My unknown friend, K. P.

Since I came to London, about a week ago, I received a letter from you,
by my friend E. F., dated the 5th of December last,
occasioned by one of mine to that friend, of which I was glad.
I am persuaded of your sincerity, and that your intent thereby is good;
and not as a busy-body, to be meddling in other men`'s matters,
but to be satisfied in things doubtful to you: and under that consideration,
I find freedom to answer your request; which I could not well do sooner,
by reason of several interposing concerns.
And though this may be lengthened, as well by my transcribing the several parts,
or genuine purport of yours, as also by the extensiveness of the subjects treated on;
yet, if thereby I can assist you with better information,
I shall think my pains well bestowed, having no end in what I shall write,
but the promotion of God`'s everlasting truth,
and the better being of your never-dying soul.

[.numbered]
1+++.+++ You say in your letter, that you, providentially, (for so to be sure it was,
since a hair of our head falls not to the ground without a
providence) met with a letter of mine to my Friend E. F.,
and was not a little surprised at the reading of it,
to find so great a sense of the love of God from one of my persuasion.
A people you always thought to be led away by a spirit of delusion and vain glory;
but that you are now fully convinced,
that whatever the authors of these suggestions were,
there are many people called by the name of Quakers, really fearing God;
and that the person I wrote to, you really takes to be such an one,
and my being so you will not question,
my letter being so full of pithy expressions of love to God, and to his Son Jesus Christ.

[.numbered]
2+++.+++ That Christ so loved mankind, as to die for us, and wash us in his own precious blood.

[.numbered]
3+++.+++ That he took upon him our nature, that he might know how to pity our infirmities;
and from there knew what need we had of strengthening ordinances,
and in love commanded us to commemorate his death till he came, etc.

[.numbered]
4+++.+++ That Christ was baptized of John, and sent forth his disciples to preach to,
and baptize all nations.

[.numbered]
5+++.+++ That they are accursed that take from, or add to the Scriptures.

[.numbered]
6+++.+++ That whosoever breaks any of the least of these commandments, namely: the sacraments,
the subjects there intended, shall not enter the kingdom of heaven.

[.numbered]
7+++.+++ That such as tell of God`'s love, and of rejoicing in it, and obey not his commands,
these pretended sacraments, must be accounted of as confessing him with their lips,
but denying him in their actions.

[.numbered]
8+++.+++ That these sacraments are better means of grace than we will make use of.

[.numbered]
9+++.+++ That God has set me upon seeking the way to heaven.

[.numbered]
10+++.+++ You advise me to make use of my reason in searching the Scriptures;
and then to tell you why I neglect those two great ordinances,
of baptism and the Lord`'s supper.

[.numbered]
11+++.+++ Of a sinless perfection in this life,
and what Scriptures I have to induce me to believe I shall arrive at it;
with your Scriptures cited against such perfection, and your reasoning therefrom.

[.numbered]
12+++.+++ That if we had no corruptions to struggle with,
we should be for building tabernacles, and abiding here.

[.numbered]
13+++.+++ That you love all those that love the Lord Jesus Christ,
and rely upon him for salvation, by the working of his holy Spirit in their hearts.

[.numbered]
14+++.+++ That the garb, manners, and conduct of our people, you greatly like.

[.numbered]
15+++.+++ But would gladly know what induces us to the above mentioned errors.

[.offset]
To all which I answer in order:

To the 1st; It reminds me of that saying of Nathaniel, concerning the Lord Jesus Christ,
'`Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?
a mean despised place it seems; and also of the answer, '`Come and see.`'
And likewise of what the Lord said to Nathaniel; '`Because I said unto you,
I saw you under the fig-tree, you believe?
You shall see greater things than these.`'
So even I, in the name of the Most High God, and Jesus Christ the eternal Son,
do write unto you, that you who have thus believed concerning the Lord,
and those who are now hated and contemned for his Name`'s sake,
if you are faithful to the manifestation of the life and light of Jesus in you,
shall see greater things than yet you see.
Your light shall then break forth as a morning without clouds,
and your peace shall shine as the sun at noon-day.

Then shall the substance take place in the midst of you,
and the shadows of the night shall fly before his glory.

[.small-break]
'''

To the 2nd; That he trod the path of regeneration,
died a sacrifice for the sins of the whole world, ascended above all heavens,
and prepared the way for all that should believe and obey to the end of the world,
is true.
But that he actually washed us, almost seventeen hundred years before we were polluted,
or had any known being in the world, which your words seem to insinuate,
is a thing worth your further consideration.
For though they, who had been great sinners in that day, as we have been in this,
though not in the same things, and came to a sense and acknowledgment of them,
were washed and purified, he does not say with water,
but in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and by the Spirit of the living God;
and these things we believe;
yet unless we come to be actually washed and purified from our actual sins,
and the old root of them too,
by the two-fold operation of the same spirit of judgment and of burning, our belief,
though true, of their being washed and sanctified in their age,
will not save us now from the pollutions, power,
and reward of our own lusts and corruptions.
The Lord open your understanding by his divine power,
and shine therein by his pure light, that you may see all things as they are.

To the 3rd; The plain sense of this is,
that the great end of Christ`'s taking upon him our nature is,
that he might thereby know how to pity our infirmities;
and from a knowledge thereof so obtained, was moved with so great compassion,
as to give us the sacraments, as the great fruits of his love and tenderness,
till he should come again at the end of the world.

This is a great perversion of the end of his coming,
and highly derogates from the glory of it;
insinuating that he was not sensible of our infirmities, nor could pity us therein,
till he acquired that knowledge by experience; reflecting upon his omniscience as God.
For he came that we might have life, not only shadows of if,
and that we might have it more abundantly: he came the second time in that generation,
according to his promise, to save his people from their sins, and not in them;
to save them from their pollutions and corruption, by the washing of regeneration,
and renewing of the Holy Ghost, the spirit of judgment and of burning,
that eternally burns, as an oven, against all corruption,
and can never be reconciled to sin; and not to establish a shadow only of cleansing.

He came to finish transgression, to put an end to sin,
and to bring everlasting righteousness into the soul of man, where it was needed;
and not some shadow of it only.

For this end likewise was the Son of God made manifest,
that he might destroy the works of the devil, which is sin in the hearts of mankind;
and not to give some signs of it only.
He came to give his life, the quickening spirit,
the true bread which comes down from heaven, to revive and preserve dead lost man;
and not only as you imagines, to give them these poor pretended ordinances,
in which there is no strength, to strengthen them.
The Lord himself, being with his people always, according to his promise, and will be,
in his own baptism of the Holy Ghost and fire, to the end of the world,
they need not any outward thing to put them in mind of him.
And sprinkling of children being an anti-christian forgery,
is not so much as a pertinent shadow of the one true baptism.

But if you will apply your heart to the Lord, in sincerity and truth,
and take up his cross daily, to your own will and natural desires,
and embrace those things he makes manifest to you, to be your duty to him and to mankind,
he will make you wiser than those who have thus taught and deceived you:
for great is his compassion and tender regard,
as I find by his grace made known in my heart, towards you at this time.

That the Lord Christ took a body of the same nature and kind as ours,
and was like us in all things, sin excepted, is true.
But whether he be come in us, is the question?
Whether that day be come in and unto us, wherein we have known,
"`that he is in the Father, and the Father in him, and he in us?`"
Or that we be yet so clouded, shadowed and benighted,
by the god and spirit of this world,
as not yet to have seen the Lord Jesus in and for ourselves?
If not, we are reprobates,
falsely covered with a vain profession of the holy name of Him we do not know.
For every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh,
the same is of God;
but every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh,
the same is antichrist.

Now, every anti-christian spirit in the world, professing Christianity,
will confess in words, that Christ is come in that blessed, prepared body,
born of the Virgin Mary;
yet none can make this true confession of Christ`'s being come in the flesh,
but such only in whom the Spirit of Christ is revealed; who have put on Christ,
and are put on of him, and are become members of him, by his life that dwells in them,
as bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh;
no more than any man can call Christ truly Lord but by the Holy Ghost;
though to call him our Lord Jesus Christ, and our Savior, in words,
is a thing very easily acquired, and common amongst most ungodly professors,
wallowing on still in all manner of sins and wickedness, and not saved by him.
Consider these things fully; and the Lord so shine in upon your heart in love,
and reveal himself in you,
that you may be able to confess him before all your acquaintance, and the world.

Again: as to those supposed ordinances of bread and wine,
and being sprinkled in the face with water in one`'s infancy,
if there was anything to boast of in these, I also might glory,
having formerly had the administration of both;
and the former with great preparation and fear, but know nothing of the latter,
but by tradition only, being too young then to know or remember anything of it; nor do,
or ever did, find any effect it had towards salvation.

In respect to the first, it is true there was something like a commandment;
for it being the passover of the Jews, and to be ended in Christ, the substance, he said,
'`This do, as often as you do it, in remembrance of me;`' not simply,
This do in remembrance of me, but, This "`do, as often as you do it,
in remembrance of me.
On which the apostle Paul, in his first Epistle to the Corinthians,
makes this observation, '`That as often as they ate that bread, and drank that cup,
they showed forth the Lord`'s death till he came.`'
This shows that it was determinable upon a certain contingency,
or within a certain limitation of time, namely: till he came.
And in that generation he came the second time, without sin unto salvation,
in those who believed and obeyed.

By which coming, this and all other types, shadows and figures of him,
were put to an end, as to any real obligation from that seeming commandment,
or any other, of a typical kind.

And yet, in condescension to some, who had believed in Christ, as to his outward coming,
that he is the Messiah and Sent of God, and were yet weak,
and not come to the experience of his presence in themselves,
being yet in an intermediate state, some eatings and drinkings,
I do not say any now in use, might be continued for a time, in some places;
though we read of none but Corinth, where they were then in a very carnal state.
But that practice did not make it necessary for ages then to come,
especially since antichrist has erected his kingdom of darkness under those shadows,
and forged idols under the cover of them, and thereby deceived the nations,
though not the elect, who cannot be deceived.
Yet that practice in those days, after the spiritual coming of the Lord Jesus Christ,
adds no more authority for the continuance or perpetuity of it,
than the practice of circumcision, vows, purifications,
and the like ceremonies and types under the law of Moses, made these necessary,
after his coming both in the flesh and spirit; some of which were not only continued,
for the reasons aforesaid, after the revelation of the Spirit of Christ, the Holy Ghost,
in them in that age; but some of them are continued,
especially in the church and kingdom of antichrist,
and among professors of Christianity unto this day, as still being needful,
in their judgment.

Breaking bread and drinking wine was a Jewish rite,
begun in the time of the captivity at Babylon, and continued till the coming of Christ,
and used at the passover and eating of the paschal lamb;
which was a type of Christ as the Lamb of God, the true vine and wine of the kingdom,
and the antitype of that figure; who made the application of it immediately to himself,
as being the real substance.

And though he was at that time come, and present with them as born of the Virgin Mary,
and the Messiah outwardly, according to the prophets, yet he was then shortly to come,
or be revealed, according to the prophecy of

Malachi, the last of the prophets, and of John the Baptist,
who prophesied of a divine coming and manifestation of the same Christ and Savior,
that is to say,
as the Mediator and Messenger of the new and second covenant of light and life;
and he is also that covenant, like a refiner`'s fire, and fuller`'s soap,
to sit in the hearts of mankind, as a refiner and purifier of silver; to make men pure,
and purer than fine gold, seven times tried in the fire;
to gather the weighty and solid wheat into the garner of God,
to be reserved there for his use, and of which is made the one bread;
but to burn up the chaff of pollutions with fire unquenchable, by him who is that fire,
the Word of God, who baptizes with the Holy Ghost, as John did with water,
and with that divine and holy fire.

'`As often as you eat this bread, and drink this cup,
you show forth the Lord`'s death till he come.`'
They therefore who are, at this day,
exercising themselves in the imitations of these things, with their own additions,
diminutions and alterations thereof, are only showing forth his death until now;
whereby they are bearing witness against themselves,
that they are not yet come to know him as the resurrection and life,
by his manifestation in them; that he is not yet revealed in them;
that they are yet dead unto the sense of the life of the Word of God,
and alienated therefrom, through the ignorance that is in them.

Christ is yet crucified in and unto them; being contented with a hear-say of him,
pretending to serve him in eating, drinking, touching, tasting and handling, in shows,
in imperfect imitations of some outward and typical shadows,
once in use in their proper dispensations of time, place, and people;
and yet deny or neglect the great everlasting command and ordinance of love.
'`Love one another; love your enemies; do good to them that hate you; be perfect:
by this shall all men know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.`'
Of these they are willingly ignorant.
And how little Christendom, falsely so called, has been in the practice of these things,
the heathen world has beheld, and has stumbled at.
How little she is in the practice of them still,
let her present circumstances demonstrate,
to all who have eyes to see the bloodshed and uncharity,
and ears to hear the cries of the poor and oppressed,
and hearts to lament the misery and judgments now on foot,
and swiftly advancing upon all false pretenders;
who are not only to be more and more vexed, by the destroying hands one of another,
but unless they speedily repent, and turn unto him,
the divine substance of all types and shadows,
even to that true light which enlightens every man that Comes into the world,
they must surely taste of the eternal judgment of the Son of God,
the great Judge of the living and of the dead;
who is now hastening upon all the kindreds of the earth.

I am the bread of life,`' said the Lord Jesus Christ,
'`the living bread which came down from heaven.
If any man eat of this bread, he shall live forever.
And the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.
Except you eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink his blood, you have no life in you.
My flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.
He that eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, dwells in me, and I in him.`'
Then said the hearers,
'`How can this man give us his flesh to eat!`' Many therefore of his disciples,
when they had heard this, said, '`This is a hard saying, who can hear it?
And, to explain his sayings, he added, '`It is the Spirit that quickens,
the flesh profits nothing: the words that I speak unto you,
they are spirit and they are life.`'
"`Yet, from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him.

Even the twelve apostles themselves seem to have been ready to stagger at his doctrine,
so far above the natural capacity of mankind, and of the hearers at that time,
as appears by his question to them in private; '`Will you also go away?
When Peter, recounting their experience, replied, '`Lord, to whom shall we go?
You have the words of eternal life.`'
As it is elsewhere written,
'`It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven;
but to them it is not given.`'
Even so it is at this day.
It is given unto those who are awakened out of sleep, to walk in the light,
and in the day of God, where there is no night or shadow,
and to be fed with this living bread and everlasting substance; but those who are asleep,
and dreaming, as in the night, that they are eating and drinking, and are satisfied,
when they awake in the morning, shall be hungry.
And then shall they know that they have been deluded with an empty dream,
and that real bread is lacking unto them,
and the true wine of the kingdom they have not tasted.

'`It is the Spirit that quickens, the flesh profits nothing.`'
And notwithstanding any use of any shadows or signs-visible, in the church of Christ,
after his descending upon them in spirit,
we find the true supper and divine substance explained,
and the way to obtain it directed to, by the Spirit of Christ,
after his glorification in heaven; and of which we are at this day made partakers,
through the infinite mercy of the Father in him; without the use of any ceremony, sign,
or shadow or of any other means than those of his own directing.
That is to say, '`As many as I love I rebuke and chasten; be zealous therefore and repent.
Behold I stand at the door and knock; if any man hear my voice, and open the door,
I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.`'
Here the love of God is the first moving cause,
and is seen in the rebukes and chastisements of his Holy Spirit,
in the hearts of mankind; and we ought to show our zeal and love to him,
by a free and hearty repentance, and forsaking of those things we are reproved for.
He will then stand at the door of such a heart,
and call more plainly and powerfully there, and knock by the hammer of his holy Word,
which breaks the rock in pieces; and whosoever shall hear, believe, and obey this voice,
and shall open his heart and door, and let in this divine guest,
shall sit with him at his heavenly table, and eat of his holy supper,
the true bread which comes down, day by day, from heaven,
and shall drink of the new wine of his kingdom, even now in this present world;
where their peace shall flow as a river, and their joy in him and the Father,
as a mighty stream.
They shall eat of the hidden manna, and fruit of the Tree of Life,
which is in the midst of the Paradise of God; and live with and in him, who was dead,
and died for them, and lives forevermore.

In all humility and honor to the sacred name of the Lord be it confessed,
I am often made partaker of this supper, with many brethren and sisters,
children of one Father, without the use of these means you talk of,
and without any self-conceited ness,
or blasphemous and vain apprehensions of our own wisdom, or being wiser than he;
for he is the wisdom of God, and the power of God, and is made unto us wisdom,
righteousness, sanctification and redemption; and by him, the heavenly substance,
we are led, directed and redeemed out of all shadows, types, and figures,
to serve God in newness of life, in love to God, and to all mankind.
Which love is the one great commandment, upon which depend all the rest, and which he,
the Lord Jesus, the great Dispenser of it in the hearts of his people,
is come to fulfill in us by his eternal power; and we are become,
and are more and more becoming, the workmanship of the Father in him, unto good works,
such as please him.

Without this new and living commandment, the observation of shadows, though once lawful,
or what men may invent to themselves, in imitation or addition thereto,
are as surely an abomination to the Lord at this day,
as the observation of things once commanded unto Israel, and in point of dispensation,
were then still in force, became as the cutting off a dog`'s neck,
and offering of swine`'s blood, because of their neglecting righteousness,
and greater matters of the law.

Every type or shadow once instituted, remained as an obligation, and in force,
until Christ, who is the antitype and substance of all types and shadows,
became that thing to man, which the type did typify or signify.
As when Christ was offered upon the cross, the Jewish offerings were ended;
when he became the High Priest of the soul,
the Jewish high priest`'s office was fully ended, etc.
Even so the Paschal lamb, and the breaking bread and drinking wine at that feast,
as part of it, were fully ended, when the true Paschal Lamb,
upon whom the saints and saved of the Lord were to feed, was fully come,
so as actually and spiritually to become meat and drink to their enlivened souls.
And in like manner also, so soon as the heavenly body of the Lord Jesus became,
experimentally, that bread of life which came down from heaven,
and his blood that new wine of the kingdom, unto the sanctified and redeemed in that day,
the breaking of bread outward, and drinking wine fully came to an end,
as to any obligation that was on any to retain the practice of it,
any more than washing the feet one of another, also a Jewish rite,
and a thing more positively commanded, and with great solemnity, and which, nevertheless,
has been little in use in the church of Christ.
And as said the apostle Paul, I speak as to wise men; judge you what I say:
the cup of blessing, which we bless,
is it not the communion of the blood of Christ I The bread which we break,
is it not the communion of the body of Christ?
For we being many, are one bread, and one body;
for we are all partakers of that one bread.`'
And blessed be the name of the Lord, so also is it now.

Great has been the apostasy of mankind from the heavenly substance,
and even from the shadow also; and all has become unto them as one shadow,
as the dark night and shadow of the earth:
and great idolatry has been committed by the professors of the name of the Lord Jesus,
therein and thereby.
And even at this day great is the apostasy from the true substance,
and superstition is committed and reigning in the imitation of this shadow,
while the living substance is still neglected and decried.

I sought the Lord in this ordinance, as you mistaking, calls it,
but found him not therein; but in a day of deep distress, and hour of bitter affliction,
when hell opened her mouth, and eternal death stood ready to devour,
when terrors unspeakable laid hold on my soul,
amazed and suddenly arrested for a debt I could not number or pay,
and despair encompassed me about;
then cried I unto the living Lord with exceeding lamentation,
from the depth of affliction, and in true resignation to his holy will,
and his mercy sprang in as the dawning of the morning.

The day dawning, the night retires, and the substance come, the shadow vanishes.
My dear, though unknown friend, when the beloved of your soul appears,
if the world and the things and friendship and glory of it, be not your beloved,
you will not then mind his picture, if it were his picture; nor mind his shadow,
though he had even said.
Look upon this till I come.
It is true, you will not then contemn his picture when he is with you: no more do I;
but have a due esteem for all he has commanded, in their times, dispensations, and ends.
Nor do I lightly esteem those who use that in
imitation with a good intent and sincere mind,
but pity them that they are come no nearer the kingdom; which,
though at hand seventeen hundred years ago,
is not yet come unto those who are set down contented under the shade of night,
and dreaming of things of which they have no knowledge or enjoyment.

Go into the sun-shine, and turn your face towards the sun,
and the shadow will be behind you; but turn your back on the sun,
and the shadow will be before you; and the more you follow it, the more it will fly you;
and the more you goest after it, the further from the sun.
And this is the state of apostatized Christendom at this day, and has been for many ages.

The kingdom of heaven is within, and stands not in eating and drinking,
nor comes with outward observation, but in righteousness and peace,
and joy in the Holy Ghost; to which the only true and living God,
through the inward revelation of his eternal Son, the Lord Jesus Christ,
bring your precious soul.
And that is the only thing that can truly satisfy,
where the soul is alive by the breath of life from God, and hungry and thirsty indeed;
though I am willing thus to take a little pains for your present information.

4thly, And now as to baptism: to John the Baptist,
who was the immediate forerunner of Christ, came the word of God in the wilderness,
commanding him to preach repentance to the Jews, to whom alone he was sent,
to proclaim the kingdom of heaven to be then at hand; and to baptize the people in water,
directing them to believe in him who was to come after him, who was Christ the Lord,
then among them, though not known at that time to be the Messiah, either by John himself,
or any other.
But John declared that he baptized with water,
and that after him was to come one more worthy and powerful than he,
who should baptize them with the Holy Spirit and fire; and that John must decrease,
and Christ increase.

When the Lord Jesus Christ did appear, he likewise preached repentance;
as also did his disciples, who baptized with the same water baptism that John did,
and at the same time, but not in the name of one to come;
testifying that Jesus is the Messiah, sent of God unto Israel.
The disciples of Christ being thus in the practice of water baptism,
contemporary with John, and the Lord Christ present with them,
they continued in that practice till after his resurrection;
and then he declared and established his own proper baptism,
so foretold by John as aforesaid, saying,
'`Repentance and remission of sins must be preached in his name unto all nations,
beginning at Jerusalem.
And you shall be witnesses unto me,`' said he, '`in Jerusalem, in Samaria,
in all the countries round about, and to the uttermost parts of the earth.
All power in heaven and in earth is given unto me; go you therefore, teach all nations,
baptizing them into the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost;
teaching them all things whatsoever I have commanded you; and lo I am with you always,
even unto the end of the world.`'
And to explain what he had thus said, he further added, '`Go into all the earth,
and preach the gospel unto every creature.
He that believes, and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believes not,
shall be damned.
And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you;
but tarry you at Jerusalem till you are endued with power from on high:
but you shall receive power, after the Holy Ghost is come upon you;
for John truly baptized with water,
but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.`'
"`By all which Scriptures it is clear that John baptized with water only;
that the disciples of Christ, in his presence, baptized with the same,
and at the same time; that John had foretold them of the baptism of the Holy Spirit,
to be administered by Christ;
and that Christ declared and appointed the baptism of the Spirit,
and not any water baptism, where he commanded them to teach all nations, baptizing them, etc.
And as the terms of their mission were into the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost;
whenever any water was used,
of which we have few instances after the coming of the Holy Spirit,
it was not in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, as from that text,
but only in the name of the Lord Jesus; which demonstrates it was John`'s baptism,
and from no new command,
but only the continuance of the practice of
water baptism they had been in during his time,
before the commencement of the baptism of the Holy Spirit,
which initiates into the divine nature.

And when the churches became able to bear the
mystery and spirituality of the true baptism,
the apostle declared that, '`there is one Lord, one faith, and one baptism.
For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body; the church, which is his body,
the fulness of him who fills all in all.`'
And as John said of his baptism, '`I must decrease;`' and of Christ`'s baptism.
He must increase;`' and that which decreases gradually comes to an end,
so water baptism came to an end many ages ago; when the church of Rome,
by her own wisdom and authority, which is from beneath,
without any institution of Christ, and being ignorant of the baptism of the Holy Spirit,
invented and imposed rantism, or sprinkling of infants, instead of the baptism of Christ,
from which they are departed, and between which there is no resemblance.

As the baptism of Christ must increase, without any determinate time of being full,
so that which increases indefinitely, never ends.

The baptism of Christ is an initiation into,
or beginning of the manifestation of his power and kingdom in the mind of man;
which kingdom is not of this world,
nor does it stand in any of the elements or powers of it,
but is his eternal power manifested in men; and as we began to know this baptism,
we began to die to the world, and to all the vainglory and evils of it,
and became hated and persecuted of those who are after the flesh,
and are not yet thus baptized or born of the Spirit,
but remain in the nature and spirit of this world.
Yet we are, by grace, made able to suffer all things,
for the sake of him who has loved us,
and into whose name and nature we were baptized by him.

And as to your notion, that as Christ was baptized with water by John,
so must we also be baptized with the same, by his example.

This is not a just consequence, but a common fallacy,
invented by the letter mongers and hirelings,
who pervert the holy Scriptures for worldly wealth, power and honor,
though to their own destruction, and the ruin also of many other souls.
For as Christ being born after the flesh among the Jews, submitted to the law of Moses,
and was circumcised, and had offerings offered for him as others had,
that he might fulfill all the righteousness of the law, and end it;
so he was likewise baptized of John,
to fulfill the righteousness of that dispensation also;
that all righteousness being fulfilled and concentered in him,
he might become righteousness, and the dispenser of it to them that believe,
through all generations.

As it is written, '`Unto us a child is born, unto lis a son is given,
and the government shall be upon his shoulder; and his name shall be called Wonderful,
Counsellor, the mighty God, the everlasting Father, +++[+++the Lord our righteousness]
the Prince of Peace.
Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end.
Who of God is made unto us wisdom, righteousness, sanctification and redemption;
for in him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.
And you are complete in him, which is the Head of all principality and power.
In whom also you are circumcised, with the circumcision made without hands,
in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ:
buried with him in baptism, wherein also you are risen with him,
through the faith of the operation of God, who has raised him from the dead, etc.
Blotting out the hand-writing of ordinances that was against us, etc.
Let no man therefore judge you in meat or in drink, or in respect of a holy day,
or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days, which are a shadow of things to come;
but the body is of Christ, etc.
Wherefore, if you be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why,
as though living in the world, are you subject to ordinances, etc.`'
"`Now, observe from this doctrine, that circumcision, baptism, with water,
and all religious ceremonies, respecting anything that may be eaten, or drunk,
or holy days, or new moons, or sabbath days, and all such like ordinances,
are here ended and fulfilled in the Lord Christ, the ever-living substance.
So that neither circumcision, nor uncircumcision, baptism with water, or no such baptism,
avails anything, but a new creature; born of him, the Word of Life, and complete in him,
who is the perfection of beauty, and head of all principality and power:
so that if we have Christ we have all,
and without him there is nothing at all in religion.

To the 5th I answer.
That this is a misapplication of the Scripture suggested in the expression;
for the words are these,
'`I testify unto every man that hears the words of the prophecy of this book,
if any man shall add unto these things,
God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book.
And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy,
God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city,`' etc.
Thus it is testified by the Holy Spirit; and the penalty here is great indeed,
and so is your accusation and charge,
but it is upon those who hear the words of the prophecy of that book, and shall add to,
or take away from the words of that book.
We are not guilty of this charge, of adding anything to that prophecy,
or taking anything from it, or of doing so to any other part of the holy Scriptures;
and so not liable to this curse or penalty.
But since actions, importing an addition of anything to the Christian religion,
as an ordinance of Christ, which is not so; or suppressing anything as an error,
which is no error, can be no less within the meaning of this Scripture,
in the nature of things, than adding or taking away of words; those are deeply guilty,
who have detained many typical things ended by the coming of Christ,
and invented and added to religion sprinkling of infants, with many impertinent,
superstitious, and idolatrous things, never commanded or ordained of Christ,
but forged in their own imaginations,
and imposed upon the professors of the faith of Christ as his ordinances,
by the violence of grievous anti-christian persecutions and murders by fire, sword,
and gallows, and all manner of cruel and inhuman tortures and torments.
And have detained and taken away the use of all the holy Scriptures from the people,
to whom, as Christians, they belong.
Then do you make haste from among them,
lest the curse you are bestowing so blindly upon the innocent,
fall upon your own head among those guilty sinners;
who are not citizens of the New Jerusalem, the holy city of God, but of Babel.

The Lord open their eyes to see, and give them hearts to understand,
and power to come out of all their inventions, to the great Baptizer and Feeder of souls;
that they may be saved from corruption, and enter those mansions, where there is no lack,
and where no unclean thing can come.
And the Lord bless you, my unknown friend, with the knowledge of his love,
and with a right understanding in all things.

To the 6th and 7th;
This likewise is a manifest wresting and misapplication
of the holy Scripture alluded to in this place;
for the Lord Jesus was not then speaking of anything called sacraments,
as commandments of God, but of the moral commandments in the law of Moses.
And I know, that while we are breaking the commandments of God,
we cannot rejoice in his love; but in that state of disobedience,
are under his wrath and reproof.
But have you seen me break any of the commandments of God?
What I wrote in that letter of the love of God, was in truth and righteousness,
as it then was manifested in my soul by the Lord Jesus Christ;
and whatever it may be accounted of by such as know him not,
yet I know it is not accounted an offense before the Lord, to tell of his goodness,
but a duty in all them that are mercifully favored with the enjoyment of it,
when thereunto called by its own virtue.

Nor does the Lord, the great Judge of the world,
at any time charge me with the breach of any of his commands,
either for disusing the bread and wine of the priests, or their rantism,
which the Lord never sent them to administer; nor the pope`'s bread, or his rantism,
and other impertinences, which the Lord never commanded.

And who are they that are thus saying, but doing the contrary?
If you know of any that are breaking the moral commands of God,
or the new and living command of the Lord Jesus, the Son of God, daily;
and teaching men so, either by the example of a sinful conduct,
or by pleading and wrangling in words for a necessity of it for term of life;
loving God with lip-love only, and serving him only with tongue-service; you may,
if free yourself, reprove such as mockers of God, but accuse not the brethren,
in whom is revealed the eternal commandment, lest you offend the Father,
and the Judge reprove you in your own bosom: but believe in,
and follow and obey the light and life of the Son of God, in the way of regeneration,
if ever you yourself expects to enter his kingdom;
which you shall never see in any invention of the children of men.

To the 8th; Where do you read,
or what experience have you that these pretended
sacraments are means to obtain the love or grace of God?
'`The grace of God, that brings salvation has appeared unto all men,
through the Lord Jesus Christ;`' and consequently to millions,
even the greatest part of all mankind, who never heard of those supposed ordinances.
'`Their sound is gone into all the earth, and their words unto the end of the world.`'
All have heard, but all have not believed or obeyed.
And he, by whom this universal grace is come upon all men,
in order to heal the universal disease, is the elect Seed of God,
and covenant with the nations; even that '`true light,
which enlightens every man that comes into the world;`'
and is '`ordained of God to be Judge of quick and dead.`'
By whom in no ways am I condemned for neglecting
these your ordinances as means of his love;
but by the mercy of the Father through him, do enjoy it, at times when it pleases him,
without any other means than his own free will and goodness.

To the 9th; Time was when I was seeking the living among the dead,
and the way to God and his kingdom among the lo-heres and lo-theres of the times;
who were severally saying, Lo here, in our liturgy and ordinances; Lo there,
in our directory, and the like ordinances, as we administer them; Lo,
in the pools and ponds with us, as we perform with a nicer imitation;
and behold yonder in the mass, and glory, and pomp of the world,
in the great wilderness of anti-christian ordinances of human invention.
But within is the kingdom, and there I have found it,
through the voice of him who speaks from heaven; and there is made known the way,
and I desire to walk on in Him who is the way, truth, light, life, and love,
and leads to the God of love; to whom be renown, dominion, and glory, forever and ever.

To the 10th: The Scripture says, '`The things of God knows no man,
but the Spirit of God, and God has revealed them by his Spirit;
for the Spirit (not the reason of man) searches all things, yes, the deep things of God.
By wisdom the world knows not God,
nor does the natural man receive the things of the Spirit of God:
for they are foolishness to him; neither can he know them,
because they are spiritually discerned.
But in the Lord Jesus, the Word of God,
'`are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge;`' by whose breath of divine life,
not by reason, is understanding given, and the Scriptures opened.

None knows the Father but the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him;
and none can come to the Son unless the Father draw him.`'
Men, by their reasoning about the things of God in a natural state, ignorant of God,
have made the gospel, to themselves, of no effect, as the Jews did the law,
by their tradition.

While I remained reasoning with flesh and blood, I had no true peace or knowledge of God;
but when it pleased him to reveal the life of his Son in me, then I denied myself,
and the world, with all the vain pleasures and glory of it, and likewise my own wisdom,
and became as a fool to the world,
that from then on I might be partaker of that wisdom and knowledge dispensed by him,
who is the Fountain and Dispenser of all true wisdom, knowledge and understanding;
by the opening and manifestation of whose Holy Spirit,
the Scriptures were given forth of old;
and the matters therein contained being things of God, are rightly to be understood,
and truly known,
only by the openings and in-shinings of the light of the same divine Word, by which,
at first, they were dictated, or the matters therein treated of made known.

And upon this Word have I ever depended since I was favored with the knowledge of God,
and not upon my own reason as a man only;
nor upon any supposed natural parts or acquirements, which, by themselves,
ought not to intermeddle with the things of God, how pregnant soever they may be.
"`And now dear friend, know that I am not a contemner of the holy Scriptures,
but do love them, and have searched them from my youth,
and have often been much comforted, and my heart has often glowed within me,
while the blessed and holy Spirit of Christ, which was in the prophets and apostles,
brought the Scriptures to my remembrance, and opened the mysteries thereof in me.
And therefore, to the Word of God,
which the noble Bereans received with all readiness of
mind before they searched the Scriptures,
do I refer you; even to the ingrafted Word, which is able to save your soul,
if you believe therein, that by the light and power of it, you may read and understand,
and have the Scriptures--as well the divine law of God written in your heart,
as the letter of the book--opened unto you:
and then shall you know the reason of my disuse of these supposed ordinances; till which,
all that can be said by man is not able to inform your understanding to the full.
But in a plain assertion of the innocent truth,
these shadows are not of God as they now stand and are used;
and being come to the immortal substance, I have no need of them,
but have the authority of the Lord and giver of life,
and the enjoyment of the divine and everlasting substance, for leaving them behind.

11th; The enemy of man having deceived him, under pretense of a friend,
and wrought sin and iniquity in his heart, and thereby defiled him,
and obtained a place in his heart, the Son of God,
through the love and mercy of the Father, is made manifest there,
to discover unto man the works of the devil, and to destroy them;
and to create man anew in the image of God, in righteousness and holiness,
and to bring forth in him a new life.
And man, being thus the perfect workmanship of the Almighty,
created anew unto good works by Jesus Christ, his thoughts, words, actions,
and deportment are changed.
As it was natural, while in his first state in this life, to think, do, and speak evil;
so, in his new nature, being born of the Spirit,
it is natural to him to think righteously, speak truth without guile,
and do good unto all men, and no evil, in thought, word, or action.

And though the Lord Jesus closed his sermon upon the mount with these words,
'`Be you therefore perfect,
even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect;`' yet it was
not by the letter of the book only that I was first induced to
believe this doctrine of sinless perfection in this life,
but by the revelation of Jesus Christ, as he is the wisdom and power of God,
who condemns sin in mankind; and by the manifest operation of his power within,
condemns the man of sin, casts him out, and spoils his goods.
And though we have many temptations, from time to time, to strive against,
we find power in the Spirit of Christ whereby to resist and overcome them.
For it is not we alone that strive or resist the evil,
but first the Spirit of Christ in us is lifted
up as a standard and ensign against the enemy,
and then we, through him, become as co-workers in effecting our own salvation,
by continuing in faith, and obedience in well doing.

If you considers only your own weakness and infirmities,
as in the nature and properties of the first Adam in the fall, in whom all die,
you will hardly believe the liberty of the sons of God;
but coming to the revealed power of Christ, the second Adam, the quickening Spirit,
in whom all are made alive, you will not only believe,
but through faithfulness to his power, which works in you against all sin,
may come to attain that perfection of righteousness and holiness,
which you can not now conceive.

And though we are tempted as he was tempted, but sinned not, yet if we do not yield,
we are not charged: for it is no sin to be tempted; but to consent,
and enter into the temptation, is sin.
And how should we know the power of the grace of God,
or what degree of virtue we have thereby attained,
if we were not tempted I And how should we distinguish the voice of the tempter,
if we knew not the voice of the Word of Life?
But as God tempts no man, nor is himself tempted of evil;
so he allows not any of his children, son or daughter,
to be tried so as not to escape the evil, if they adhere to his grace.

By a sinless state in this life,
we do not mean such a degree wherein it is not possible for us to commit sin;
but such a stability in Christ, in whom there is no sin,
that we may resist all the temptations we meet with, after our old sins,
in time of ignorance, are pardoned by faith in the blood of Christ,
and our whole man sanctified, justified, and strengthened, by his power remaining in us,
against the old adversary; who still seeks to regain, by his subtlety,
his old place in us as before,
by means of any passion or affection unmortified or unsubdued.

Christ said to the Jews who did not believe, '`If you believe not that I am he,
you shall die in your sins.
Where I go, you cannot come.`'
And again, to those who did believe, '`If you continue in my word,
then are you my disciples indeed.
And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.
And if the truth make you free, then are you free indeed.`'
In this they did not understand him, as appears by their answer.
They thought he had meant some outward freedom; but he intended their freedom from sin,
which is a greater deliverance than out of Egyptian bondage.
By this it appears that if we die in our sins, we cannot enter the kingdom of heaven.
There is then great need that we come to Him in time, who alone is able to save us:
as it is written, '`He shall save his people from their sins;`' but not in them.

The more we obey the discoveries and leadings of the Spirit of truth,
the more he sets us free; and the more we are co-workers with Christ,
the more perfect we are.
Many things which have formerly been temptations to us,
being overcome by faith in his grace,
given by the word of faith working in our hearts by love, are now no temptations at all;
so that the work becomes easier by degrees.
I know the Lord is able to carry on his own work, when, and how,
and to what degree it pleases him.
And if the creature resists him not,
and quenches not the holy Spirit by willful or known sinning against him,
his work of perfection, as all his works are perfect, can never fail.

They who are God`'s workmanship in his Son, are perfect, so far as he has wrought;
and they who have given way, and been coworkers with Satan, so far are imperfect.
If then, Satan, who is a creature, was able,
through the subtle working of his power and cunning, which is finite,
to deprave innocent man, and betray him into sin and death; much more is God,
the Creator of all things,
by his infinite power and wisdom revealed in man through Jesus Christ,
able to restore mankind to his first innocence and image of God,
in righteousness and perfect holiness, to dissolve the chains of death,
and fix him forever in the bounds of eternal love, light, and glory; where no darkness,
temptation, or defilement, can approach, nor any fear of falling, can appear forevermore.

Oh, my unknown friend!
Great is the mystery of the redemption of poor lost man, who,
through his ignorance of the Almightiness of God`'s saving arm,
is ready to fix limits and bounds to the immense God; whose wisdom is past finding out,
and incomparably transcends all the imaginations of the thoughts of every creature,
men and angels.
I could tell you many things, but you are not in a condition to hear them;
and had much rather you should come to the knowledge of that power which makes perfect,
than write many things to you concerning it; which, in the state you are in,
might prove a stumbling block, instead of assistance, to you.

But though it was not the Holy Scriptures that
first induced me to believe this doctrine,
yet I have met with many passages therein since, which fully prove it,
some of which I have before pointed at herein.
The great end of the coming of the Son of God, is to save mankind from the power of sin,
the cause of eternal death, and separation from God; and that sin being removed,
with all its evil effects, which stood as a partition wall,
man might again have present fellowship, in measure, with the Lord,
and walk with him in newness of life, and finally be crowned with unspeakable glory.

God is light; sin is darkness; and between these two there can be no fellowship.
But sin being pardoned--as declared--by faith in the blood of Christ,
and the root thereof done away and destroyed, by the manifestation of his holy Spirit,
then men come to dwell in Christ, as he dwells in the Father;
and so they have true knowledge of, and fellowship with, the Father and the Son,
and with one another in him, who is light, in whom there is no sin, nor darkness,
nor shadow at all:
which knowledge and fellowship is greatly lacking among the professors of Christ,
in this confused age of the world.

As to that passage you allude to in an Epistle of John, where it is said,
'`If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.`'
If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.
The context proves the contrary to your intention: for in the seventh verse he says,
that '`if we walk in the light, as he is in the light,
we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son,
cleanses us from all sin.`'
And again, '`If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins,
and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.`'

The Jews were a people who built much on the works of their law,
thinking themselves blameless in a strict performance of them;
as '`Paul was circumcised the eighth day,`' etc.,
'`touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.`'
And it seems, by the tenor of the apostle John`'s Epistle,
some such there were among the disciples at that time,
who were not come rightly to see that they were, or had been, sinners;
and so could not see the true reason of the coming of Christ,
to make them righteous and just, by his inward work;
which could not be till they came to a real
sight of their own sinful and degenerate state;
and that all the works of their law, which they could work in that natural state,
were but as an unclean thing.
And that apostle having labored to convince them, first, that they had sinned,
and were sinners, notwithstanding their legal performances,
how strictly or exactly soever observed, and though as to these they might be blameless;
he then proceeds to preach perfect redemption and salvation by Jesus Christ,
especially by his inward workings and teachings in their minds,
figuratively termed anointing; as it is written concerning himself,
simply considered as man, '`That God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost.`'

And what man ever more fully preached the doctrine of perfection in this life,
or spoke of higher attainments here, than this apostle does in that epistle;
where he says, '`Whosoever is born of God, does not commit sin: for his seed (that is,
the word of God) remains in him; and he cannot sin, because he is born of God?`'
Again, '`I have written unto you, young men, because you are strong,
and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the wicked one.`'
And their '`fellowship was with the Father and the Son,`' in the pure light,
where no sin can come: and the apostles were not only there themselves,
but were laboring in the spirit and power of Christ,
to bring those to whom they preached and wrote, to the same state and fellowship.

And though what I have already said to this 12th head, and to the former,
might be a sufficient answer to the extent of your meaning therein; yet,
being zealous for your convincement of the truth and conversion to God,
I shall proceed further, and add,
that I observe that the children of the flesh and of this world,
champions for sin and the kingdom and rule of Satan, both by word and practice,
commonly wrest several particular Scriptures to
support themselves and one another in sin,
to the end of their days, to their final destruction:
such as this expression of the apostle John, already noted,
that '`If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves,
and the truth is not in us;`' and where the apostle Paul says,
'`That which I do I allow not; for what I would that do I not, but what I hate,
that do I. O wretched man that I am,
who shall deliver me from the body of this death!`' From these
Scriptures some ungodly men perversely contend that those apostles,
and consequently all the primitive Christians,
were still sinners at the times of writing those Scriptures,
and continued in sin during life; upon a false supposition,
that all mankind are under an unavoidable necessity,
from the weakness of nature and constitution, so to continue to the end of this life.
This I oppose, and say, that as the apostles, as well as others, had been sinners,
before they believed in Christ and were converted;
so it was common with them to use that condescending way of expression,
in terms once applicable to themselves as well as to others:
as where the apostle James also says, '`The tongue can no man tame: it is an unruly evil,
full of deadly poison; therewith bless we God, even the Father;
and therewith curse we men.`'
Whereas, at that time, this apostle was not a curser of men, if ever he had so been.
No more were the apostles John and Paul then sinners; but had known,
not only forgiveness through faith in the blood of Christ,
but also a sanctification and cleansing from all unrighteousness and sin,
by '`the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost;`' and,
as you yourself have expressed the thing in the thirteenth paragraph, or head,
but without knowledge, namely: '`By the working of the holy Spirit in their hearts.`'

And you may see that John writes in that epistle,
to three different states in the church at that time,
and the same diversity continues still.
To little children in religion, though they might be men in nature,
that they should not sin: for he knew children in the faith were yet weak,
and might offend and fall; but if they should,
he instructed them how they might rise again, through the mercy of God in Jesus Christ,
declared unto all men, by the blood of his cross shed once for all.
To young men in the faith, that they should not sin: Why?
Because they were strong, and established in the faith and word of life,
and had already thereby overcome the wicked one, with all his temptations;
being begotten and born of God, and become his children,
though once merely the children of Adam and of this world: and to fathers in Christ,
and in the church of God,
who were come to a more full and mature knowledge of God and Christ,
revealed in them as a light, without the least darkness of any type, figure,
or shadow at all; and to a more ample perfection in Him,
through whom they were so far from sin at that time,
that they were become the light of the world,
by the light of Him whose glory shined in them.

Your other suggestion,
against the power and efficacy of the Christian faith and religion,
arises from the words of the apostle Paul,
before noted or some other Scriptures misapplied, which you do not understand.

How true is that saying, '`The letter kills, but the spirit gives life!`' Men,
falling to work upon the Scriptures in their sinful state,
with their own reason and wisdom from beneath---not knowing the Scriptures,
nor the power of God by the work thereof in their
hearts--have erred from the truth themselves,
and lead astray others also.

I shall therefore begin with the doctrine of the apostle Paul,
in the Epistle to the Romans,
and observe the manner of his proceeding in preaching the gospel:
he sets forward with mankind, both Jews and Gentiles,
as all once concluded under sin and unbelief; where he says, '`We have before proved,
both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin.`'
And yet they were not to continue therein,
but were dead unto sin by the baptism of the Spirit of Christ:
and then proceeds to illustrate his doctrine by way of comparison;
'`that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory (or power) of the Father,
even so we also should walk in newness of life:`' importing,
that as sure as Christ was raised from the dead; so, by the same spirit and power,
they who then believed, and had been baptized with the baptism of the spirit,
had attained a new life in him.
Again: '`For in that he died, he died unto sin once; but in that he lives,
he lives unto God.`'
So, by analogy, '`Likewise reckon you also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin;
but alive unto God, through Jesus Christ, our Lord.`'
Who then can deny the death and resurrection of Christ,
but he that will deny any freedom from sin in this life,
through the power of Jesus Christ, our Lord?
And further, '`Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?
God forbid: and shall we sin, because we are not under the law,
but under grace`'! God forbid.`'
And since God has forever forbidden sin, under both the law and gospel,
and offered a free redemption therefrom, with all its dreadful effects,
through Jesus Christ, his Son, let us lay hold of it with all readiness.
Observing further the doctrine of this apostle in the same chapter,
'`Being then made free from sin, you became the servants of righteousness;
for when you were the servants of sin, you were free from righteousness: but now,
being made free from sin, and become the servants of God,
you have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life:
for the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life, through Jesus Christ,
our Lord.`'
Read the whole chapter with attention.

But that which gives occasion to many, who are ignorant of the things of God,
and yet full of themselves and of their own dark conceivings,
and willing to favor and live in sin, to mistake or pervert this doctrine,
and imagine that the apostle contradicts all this in the seventh chapter, is this:
he having closed and finished his doctrine under the
similitude of Christ`'s death and resurrection,
in the latter end of the sixth chapter,
resumes the same doctrine in the beginning of the seventh,
under the similitude of marriage under the law;
which he directs in a more particular manner to them
who were acquainted with the rules and customs of it.
And in handling the same doctrine under that other similitude,
he impersonates several states, wherein men commonly were in a state of nature,
and under the law, before they came to the knowledge of the Lord Christ,
as if then his own; which to himself, and the saints contemporary with him,
were then really past and over,
and he and they arrived at another degree and dispensation.
He was endeavoring to excite them that were yet short,
to come further forward in the same way of life and salvation; from state to state;
from their initiation into the same, by the baptism of Christ,
till they should be perfect in him.
And, having spoken of these inferior states as in his own person, for illustration,
and to be more intelligible, in the same chapter he cries out, '`O wretched man that I am,
who shall deliver me from the body of this death!`' And,
in the next verse answers his own question, and says, '`I thank God, through Jesus Christ,
our Lord:`' and further adds,
'`There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus,
who walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit;
for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus,
has made me free from the law of sin and death.`'

Now, neither the apostle, nor any other, could be both delivered and not delivered,
both in bondage and free, in the time of the writing these few verses;
which might all be done in half an hour.
I conclude, therefore,
with understanding that the apostle here impersonates two opposite states;
that of sin under the law, in a natural condition, and that of liberty from sin,
by grace through Christ; and that the latter was his own,
and of those also who had received and obeyed the gospel.
The gospel, and the effects of it, are the same throughout all generations unto this day,
in and unto all that believe, receive and obey the same; though they that do not,
remain as they were by nature, or degenerate more and more to perdition.

And seeing the same apostle labored to present every man perfect in Christ Jesus,
he himself was not excluded.
And can you think that the all-wise and all-powerful God, Lord of heaven and earth,
set this great apostle and the rest of them upon labor in vain;
which must needs have been, if they labored to present the believers perfect in Christ,
and it had not been attainable.

And that this blessed freedom and glorious liberty of
the sons of God is not attainable in this present world,
is only a dream in the night, which is yet over the nations in too general a way,
told and propagated by ignorant and inexperienced pretenders in this age,
who measure the attainments of the apostles and primitive saints,
as also of this present time,
by the very unequal measure and false standard of their own corruptions;
and the wisdom and power of God, by their weak and carnal knowledge:
for which the Most High will shortly rebuke them in judgment,
and call them to account for their great presumption.

'''

Now, to the 12th head: though what has been said to the 11th,
and some parts of the former, might be sufficient also to this; yet,
being desirous to do you all the help and service I may,
I proceed upon this likewise in a particular manner;
that we have corruptions to struggle with we are very sensible;
our own natural corruptions, and a subtle unwearied adversary,
lurking and working therein, seeking to entangle us again in the yoke of bondage.
But we are likewise sensible that it is one tiling to be tempted,
but another to remain in sin: for Christ was tempted, yet without sin;
tempted of Satan with the power, riches, and other glories of this world,
by which poor mortals are commonly enticed, yet he overcame the evil one;
tempted by weak and cunning men, children of the evil one, by ensnaring questions,
false accusations, lies and slanders;
by the rude and impudent contradictions of bold and ignorant sinners.
Yet he, being the wisdom of the Father, put them all to silence; and finally,
by patience and his cross, he overcame the world and all the power and enemies therein.
And the holy One, who thus overcame in his own person, prevails also in us,
by his own wisdom and power, against all our sins and corruptions;
and against the evil one and all his subtleties and power;
and over the principalities and powers of this world,
and the temptations arising therefrom;
and against spiritual wickedness exalted in the high places of the earth;
as our eyes are kept open and watchful towards the Lord,
and our confidence remains in him, and our faith in his power and love.

As to that Scripture hinted at, '`in building tabernacles here in this world,`' I observe,
that the transfiguration of Christ was a figure of his glorification,
and also a representation of the then present dispensation of
God and the condition of his church at that and future times:
there was Moses, representing the law by him, then not fully ended; Elias,
the dispensation of the doctrine and baptism of John, then likewise, in some degree,
remaining; with Christ, the only dispenser of the gospel and eternal substance,
and Mediator of the new covenant of light, life, and glory.
And after the glorification of Christ, neither Moses remained, nor Elias;
the law of ceremonies, nor John`'s baptism; but Christ alone upon the mount,
with his disciples; representing his church,
directed by the voice from the excellent glory, to hear him.
And the soul-quickening voice of the Son,
which brings forth the good pleasure of the Father therein, is his Holy Spirit;
as it is written,
'`He that has an ear let him hear what the Spirit says unto the churches.`'

It is this great and powerful voice out of heaven, by which the worlds were made,
which says, '`Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them;
and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.`'
The tabernacle of God is his church and people, as say the apostles Peter and Paul:
'`For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved,
we have a building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens:
for we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened;
not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon,
that mortality might be swallowed up of life.`'

We have no cause therefore to erect tabernacles here of our own inventing,
since a far more glorious degree is to be received here after,
by all those who hold out to the end of the race; which made not only some then,
but others also now, desire to be dissolved, that they might be with Christ alone,
in the fulness of that love, light, and glory,
which our souls have in measure been made partakers of;
to the praise of Him who lives forever and ever; and because he lives,
we live also in and by him.

Though the true God and his holy name, and this his tabernacle,
and those who dwell in heaven, may be blasphemed for a time by the beast and dragon,
and the worshippers of them; and by the synagogue of Satan, and of his tabernacle,
who live in sin and uncleanness, or rather are dead therein,
in the darkness of the earth and spirit and life of this world:
yet He who tabernacles in his saints, shall shortly wipe away all tears from their eyes;
and there shall be no more death unto them, neither sorrow, nor crying, nor pain.

13th; I can assure you, if you can believe me,
that all true Quakers truly love the Lord Jesus Christ,
and rely upon him alone for the completion of that salvation which he has begun in us,
by the working of the Holy Spirit in our hearts; but say also,
that we must be co-workers with him in our salvation, with fear and trembling.
By reason of that trembling,
arising from a true dread of his awful presence while not fully reconciled,
we have received that name of contempt and scorn
by such as have seen the effect sometimes,
when the cause has been hid from their eyes.
And whatever may befall you for lack of obedience to your convictions in time to come,
I can sincerely wish the increase of that love in you,
and that you may testify it before the world in God`'s appointed season;
remembering that saying of our Lord Jesus Christ,
'`Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men,
him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven.
But whosoever shall deny me before men,
him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.
He that receives you, receives me; and he that receives me, receives him that sent me.

14th; The garb, manners, and conduct of our people you greatly like.
O my beloved friend, the Lord is come near you, and have you considered it?
In the love and fear of the Most High I write unto you,

for the Lord God of Sabaoth shall demand your garb, your manners, your conduct,
your crown and your glory, that he may give you a garb, manners, and conduct;
and upon your resignation and obedience shall depend your peace and your glory,
which the Lord God of never changing love shall crown you with, or not,
according to the integrity or deceit of your inmost soul.

The Lord God of life, truth, and peace, be merciful to you in the midst of judgment,
and bear up your mind in the approaching trial,
says the soul of him who is deeply concerned for you on that account,
in the universal love of the Father of mercies, manifested by our Lord Jesus Christ;
through whom, unto the invisible, just, merciful, and all-powerful God and Father,
be offered and ascribed eternal honor and immortal praise; for he is worthy of all love,
obedience and renown, forever and ever.
Amen.

who was convinced of the way of Truth; but being engaged in marriage,
could not decline that, or embrace the cross of Christ and despise the shame,
and so fell back, and never made any profession with us.
